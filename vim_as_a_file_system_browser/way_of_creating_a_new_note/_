x-> Projects -> Vim as a file system browser -> Way of creating a new note
When the user enters:
*new_note*:
Here is the body of the new note.
A single dot specifies the end of the note body.
.

Vinote creates a *new_note* which contains the text between `*:` and `.`. When
this note is reloaded the text between `*:` and `.` disappeared. However when
expanding a note it shows the content in the same format.
