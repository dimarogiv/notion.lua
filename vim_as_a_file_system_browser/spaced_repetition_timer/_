x-> Projects -> Vim as a file system browser -> Spaced repetition timer
When launching vinote a window with the first thing to try to recall pops up.
There should be questions the user set before for that note, or no questions and
just note name, in this case the user should just try to replicate everything
written in the note as precisely as possible.

There should be 4 options:
  1. postpone repetition and go to the last viewed note
  2. recalled, go to the next question, if any
  3. didn't recall, reset spaced repetition timer and go to the next note, if
      any
  4. go to the original text and read it
